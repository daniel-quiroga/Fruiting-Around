**The Challenge:** Traces for creative learning
**Purposes:** Design traces for creative activities, for example, for users to learn how to paint (drawing and calligraphy), compose music, play instruments, and other interesting learning

**Keywords:** Creative, fun, tangible

**How to build it**

1 Glue two ice cream popsicles together 20X

2 Use the the posicles to secure them to the servos with a cable strap

3 Create an arm with the servos and popsicles like this: https://github.com/daniel-quiroga/Fruiting-Around/issues/2#issue-802265605

4 Strap the laser to the point

5 Fill the base with plasteline

6 Create a counter balance on the arm with plasteline

7 Connect the servos to the Arduino Uno. Servo 1 being the closest to the base, Servo 2 the  second closest, and Servo 3 the farthest from the base.

8 Secure the cables

9 Paint the prototype white

10 Create a a cardboard base 20cm x 50cm

11 Cover the base with a fruit collage and the fruit scale(see video)

12 Make cardboard bases like this:
